Hi I'm Paras Dahal, a machine learning graduate student at University of Amsterdam. This blog is my attempt at addressing concepts and ideas in machine learning I find interesting by trying to take a deep dive, yet not sacrificing readability.

Get in touch with me at _parasdahal99 [at] gmail.com_ or via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/parasdahal).

PS: If you would like to guest-write on this blog, let me know!
