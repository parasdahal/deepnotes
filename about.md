Hi there. My name is Paras Dahal. I'm currently a machine learning graduate student at University of Amsterdam. Before that I worked at an AI startup as an ML Engineer, developing systems to detect and prevent user churn.

This blog is my attempt at addressing concepts and ideas in machine learning I find interesting by trying to take a deep dive, yet not sacrificing readability.

Get in touch with me at *parasdahal99 [at] gmail.com* or via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/parasdahal). 

PS: If you would like to guest-write in this blog, feel free to let me know!
